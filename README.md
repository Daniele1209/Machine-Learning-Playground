# Machine Learning Playground

## Content
In this repository i will post my AI projects as I make them, most of them will be from the books: "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow", "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python", both of which are published by O'Reilly; some Kaggle challanges or just fun projects.
