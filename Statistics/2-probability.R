# Reliability Theory
# compare two air plane designs with respect to their safety:
# 1 a three-engine design with a main engine and two side engines. It will crash when either the main engine fails or both side engines.
# 2 a four-engine design with two side engines on the left and the right. The plane crashes if both engines of one side fail.
